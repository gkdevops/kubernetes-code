UPGRADE:
* For NGINX, use the 1.10.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.10.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.10.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.10.0-ubi`
* For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.10.0 source code.
* For Helm, use version 0.8.0 of the chart.
* As a result of [1270](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1270) and [1277](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1277), the Ingress Controller improved validation of Ingress annotations: more annotations are validated and validation errors are reported via events for Ingress resources. Additionally, the default behavior for invalid annotation values was changed: instead of using the default values, the Ingress Controller will reject a resource with an invalid annotation value, which will make clients see `404` responses from NGINX. See this [document](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/ingress-resources/advanced-configuration-with-annotations/#validation) to learn more. Before upgrading, ensure the Ingress resources don't have annotations with invalid values. Otherwise, after the upgrade, the Ingress Controller will reject such resources.
* In [1232](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1232) `controller.serviceAccount.imagePullSecrets` was removed. Use the new `controller.serviceAccount.imagePullSecretName` instead.
* The Policy resource was promoted to `v1`. If you used the `alpha1` version, the policies are needed to be recreated with the `v1` version. Before upgrading the Ingress Controller, run the following command to remove the `alpha1` policies CRD (that will also remove all existing `alpha1` policies):
    ```
     kubectl delete crd policies.k8s.nginx.org
    ```
  As part of the upgrade, make sure to create the `v1` policies CRD. See the corresponding instructions for the [manifests](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/#create-custom-resources) and [Helm](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-helm/#upgrading-the-crds) installations.

  Also note that all policies except for `accessControl` are still in preview. To enable them, run the Ingress Controller with `- -enable-preview-policies` command-line argument (`controller.enablePreviewPolicies` Helm parameter).
* It is necessary to update secret resources. See the section UPDATING SECRETS below.

UPDATING SECRETS:

In [1225](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1225), as part of improving how the Ingress Controller handles secret resources, we added a requirement for secrets to be of one of the following types:
- `kubernetes.io/tls` for TLS secrets.
- `nginx.org/jwk` for JWK secrets.
- `nginx.org/ca` for CA secrets.

The Ingress Controller now ignores secrets that are not of a supported type. As a consequence, special upgrade steps are required.

Before upgrading, ensure that the secrets referenced in Ingress, VirtualServer or Policies resources are of a supported type, which is configured via the `type` field. Because that field is immutable, it is necessary to either:
* Recreate the secrets. Note that in this case, the client traffic for the affected resources will be rejected for the period during which a secret doesn't exist in the cluster.
* Create copies of the secrets and update the affected resources to reference the copies. The copies need to be of a supported type. In contrast with the previous options, this will not make NGINX reject the client traffic.

It is also necessary to update the default server secret and the wildcard secret (if it was configured) in case their type is not `kubernetes.io/tls`. The steps depend on how you installed the Ingress Controller: via manifests or Helm. Performing the steps will not lead to a disruption of the client traffic, as the Ingress Controller retains the default and wildcard secrets if they are removed.

For *manifests installation*:
1. Recreate the default server secret and the wildcard secret with the type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
1. Upgrade the Ingress Controller.

For *Helm installation*, there two cases:
1. If Helm created the secrets (you configured `controller.defaultTLS.cert` and `controller.defaultTLS.key` for the default secret and `controller.wildcardTLS.cert` and `controller.wildcardTLS.key` for the wildcard secret), then no special upgrade steps are required: during the upgrade, the Helm will remove the existing default and wildcard secrets and create new ones with different names with the type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
1.  If you created the secrets separately from Helm (you configured `controller.defaultTLS.secret` for the default secret and `controller.wildcardTLS.secret` for the wildcard secret):
    1. Recreate the secrets with the type `kubernetes.io/tls`.
    1. Upgrade to the new Helm release.

NOTES:
* Helm 2 clients are no longer supported due to reaching End of Life: https://helm.sh/blog/helm-2-becomes-unsupported/

CHANGES:
* [1182](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1182) Update NGINX version to 1.19.3.

UPGRADE:
* For NGINX, use the 1.9.0 image from our DockerHub: `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.9.0`, `nginx/nginx-ingress:1.9.0-alpine` or `nginx-ingress:1.9.0-ubi`
* For NGINX Plus, please build your own image using the 1.9.0 source code.
* For Helm, use version 0.7.0 of the chart.

For Kubernetes >= 1.18, when upgrading using the [manifests](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/), make sure to update the [ClusterRole](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/v1.9.0/deployments/rbac/rbac.yaml) and create the [IngressClass resource](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/v1.9.0/deployments/common/ingress-class.yaml), which is required for Kubernetes >= 1.18. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will fail to start. If you run multiple NGINX Ingress Controllers in the cluster, each Ingress Controller must have its own IngressClass resource. As the `-use-ingress-class-only` argument is now ignored (see NOTES), make sure your Ingress resources have the `ingressClassName` field or the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation set to the name of the IngressClass resource. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will ignore them.

HELM UPGRADE:
* If you're using custom resources like VirtualServer and TransportServer (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), after you run the `helm upgrade` command, the CRDs will not be upgraded. After running the `helm upgrade` command, run `kubectl apply -f deployments/helm-chart/crds` to upgrade the CRDs.
* For Kubernetes >= 1.18, a dedicated IngressClass resource, which is configured by `controller.ingressClass`, is required per helm release. Ensure `controller.ingressClass` is not set to the name of the IngressClass of other releases or Ingress Controllers. As the `controller.useIngressClassOnly` parameter is now ignored (see NOTES), make sure your Ingress resources have the `ingressClassName` field or the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation set to the value of `controller.ingressClass`. Otherwise, the Ingress Controller will ignore them.

NOTES:
* When using Kubernetes >= 1.18, the `-use-ingress-class-only` command-line argument is now ignored, and the Ingress Controller will only process resources that belong to its class. See [IngressClass doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/running-multiple-ingress-controllers/#ingress-class) for more details.
* For Kubernetes >= 1.18, a dedicated IngressClass resource, which is configured by `controller.ingressClass`, is required per helm release. When upgrading or installing releases, ensure `controller.ingressClass` is not set to the name of the IngressClass of other releases or Ingress Controllers.

* [953](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/953): Fix error logging of master/minion ingresses.

HELM CHART:
* The version of the helm chart is now 0.6.0.
* Add new parameters to the Chart: `controller.appprotect.enable`, `controller.globalConfiguration.create`, `controller.globalConfiguration.spec`, `controller.readyStatus.enable`, `controller.readyStatus.port`, `controller.config.annotations`, `controller.reportIngressStatus.annotations`. Added in  [1035](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1035), [1034](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1034), [1029](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1029), [1003](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1003) thanks to [RubyLangdon](https://github.com/RubyLangdon).
* [1047](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1047) and [1009](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1009): Change how Helm manages the custom resource defintions (CRDs) to support installing multiple Ingress Controller releases. **Note**: If you're using the custom resources (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), this is a breaking change. See the HELM UPGRADE section below for the upgrade instructions.

CHANGES:
* Update NGINX version to 1.19.1.
* Update NGINX Plus to R22.
* [1029](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/1029): Add readiness endpoint. The Ingress Controller now exposes a readiness endpoint on port `8081` and the path `/nginx-ready`. The endpoint returns a `200` response after the Ingress Controller finishes the initial configuration of NGINX at the start. The pod template was updated to use that endpoint in a readiness probe.
* [980](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/pull/980): Enable leader election by default.

UPGRADE:

* For Helm, use version 0.6.0 of the chart.

HELM UPGRADE:

If you're using custom resources like VirtualServer and TransportServer (`controller.enableCustomResources` is set to `true`), after you run the `helm upgrade` command, the CRDs and the corresponding custom resources will be removed from the cluster. Before upgrading, make sure to back up the custom resources. After running the `helm upgrade` command, run `kubectl apply -f deployments/helm-chart/crds` to re-install the CRDs and then restore the custom resources.

NOTES:
* As part of installing a release, Helm will install the CRDs unless that step is disabled (see the [corresponding doc](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-helm/)). The installed CRDs include the CRDs for all Ingress Controller features, including the ones disabled by default (like App Protect with `aplogconfs.appprotect.f5.com` and `appolicies.appprotect.f5.com` CRDs).

HELM UPGRADE:

If leader election (the `controller.reportIngressStatus.enableLeaderElection` parameter) is enabled, when upgrading to the new version of the Helm chart:
1. Make sure to specify a new ConfigMap lock name (`controller.reportIngressStatus.leaderElectionLockName`) different from the one that was created by the current version. To find out the current name, check ConfigMap resources in the namespace where the Ingress Controller is running.
1. After the upgrade, delete the old ConfigMap.

Otherwise, the helm upgrade will not succeed.
