# Cross-namespace Configuration

You can spread the Ingress configuration for a common host across multiple Ingress resources using Mergeable Ingress resources. Such resources can belong to the *same* or *different* namespaces. This enables easier management when using a large number of paths. See the [Mergeable Ingress Resources](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v1.10.1/examples/mergeable-ingress-types) example on our GitHub.

As an alternative to Mergeable Ingress resources, you can use [VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources](/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/virtualserver-and-virtualserverroute-resources/) for cross-namespace configuration. See the [Cross-Namespace Configuration](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/tree/v1.10.1/examples-of-custom-resources/cross-namespace-configuration) example on our GitHub.
