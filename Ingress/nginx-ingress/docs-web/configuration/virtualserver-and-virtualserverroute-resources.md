# VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute Resources

The VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources are new load balancing configuration, introduced in release 1.5 as an alternative to the Ingress resource. The resources enable use cases not supported with the Ingress resource, such as traffic splitting and advanced content-based routing. The resources are implemented as [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).

This document is the reference documentation for the resources. To see additional examples of using the resources for specific use cases, go to the [examples-of-custom-resources](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/v1.10.1/examples-of-custom-resources) folder in our GitHub repo.

## VirtualServer Specification

The VirtualServer resource defines load balancing configuration for a domain name, such as `example.com`. Below is an example of such configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1
kind: VirtualServer
metadata:
  name: cafe
spec:
  host: cafe.example.com
  tls:
    secret: cafe-secret
  upstreams:
  - name: tea
    service: tea-svc
    port: 80
  - name: coffee
    service: coffee-svc
    port: 80
  routes:
  - path: /tea
    action:
      pass: tea
  - path: /coffee
    action:
      pass: coffee
  - path: ~ ^/decaf/.*\\.jpg$
    action:
      pass: coffee
  - path: = /green/tea
    action:
      pass: tea
```

   * - ``path``
     - The path of the route. NGINX will match it against the URI of a request. Possible values are: a prefix (\ ``/``\ , ``/path``\ ), an exact match (\ ``=/exact/match``\ ), a case insensitive regular expression (\ ``~*^/Bar.*\\.jpg``\ ) or a case sensitive regular expression (\ ``~^/foo.*\\.jpg``\ ). In the case of a prefix (must start with ``/``\ ) or an exact match (must start with ``=``\ ), the path must not include any whitespace characters, ``{``\ , ``}`` or ``;``. In the case of the regex matches, all double quotes ``"`` must be escaped and the match can't end in an unescaped backslash ``\``. The path must be unique among the paths of all routes of the VirtualServer. Check the `location <https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location>`_ directive for more information.

     - The default action to perform for a request.
     - `action <#action>`_
     - No*
   * - ``splits``
     - The default splits configuration for traffic splitting. Must include at least 2 splits.
     - `[]split <#split>`_
     - No*

     - No
   * - ``route``
     - The name of a VirtualServerRoute resource that defines this route. If the VirtualServerRoute belongs to a different namespace than the VirtualServer, you need to include the namespace. For example, ``tea-namespace/tea``.
     - ``string``
     - No*
   * - ``errorPages``
     - The custom responses for error codes. NGINX will use those responses instead of returning the error responses from the upstream servers or the default responses generated by NGINX. A custom response can be a redirect or a canned response. For example, a redirect to another URL if an upstream server responded with a 404 status code.
     - `[]errorPage <#errorpage>`_
     - No
   * - ``location-snippets``
     - Sets a custom snippet in the location context. Overrides the ``location-snippets`` ConfigMap key.

```

\* -- a route must include exactly one of the following: `action`, `splits`, or `route`.

## VirtualServerRoute Specification

The VirtualServerRoute resource defines a route for a VirtualServer. It can consist of one or multiple subroutes. The VirtualServerRoute is an alternative to [Mergeable Ingress types](/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/ingress-resources/cross-namespace-configuration).

In the example below, the VirtualServer `cafe` from the namespace `cafe-ns` defines a route with the path `/coffee`, which is further defined in the VirtualServerRoute `coffee` from the namespace `coffee-ns`.

VirtualServer:
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1
kind: VirtualServer
metadata:
  name: cafe
  namespace: cafe-ns
spec:
  host: cafe.example.com
  upstreams:
  - name: tea
    service: tea-svc
    port: 80
  routes:
  - path: /tea
    action:
      pass: tea
  - path: /coffee
    route: coffee-ns/coffee
```

VirtualServerRoute:
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1
kind: VirtualServerRoute
metadata:
  name: coffee
  namespace: coffee-ns
spec:
  host: cafe.example.com
  upstreams:
  - name: latte
    service: latte-svc
    port: 80
  - name: espresso
    service: espresso-svc
    port: 80
  subroutes:
  - path: /coffee/latte
    action:
      pass: latte
  - path: /coffee/espresso
    action:
      pass: espresso
```

Note that each subroute must have a `path` that starts with the same prefix (here `/coffee`), which is defined in the route of the VirtualServer. Additionally, the `host` in the VirtualServerRoute must be the same as the `host` of the VirtualServer.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Type
     - Required
   * - ``host``
     - The host (domain name) of the server. Must be a valid subdomain as defined in RFC 1123, such as ``my-app`` or ``hello.example.com``. Wildcard domains like ``*.example.com`` are not allowed. Must be the same as the ``host`` of the VirtualServer that references this resource.
     - ``string``
     - Yes
   * - ``upstreams``
     - A list of upstreams.
     - `[]upstream <#upstream>`_
     - No
   * - ``subroutes``
     - A list of subroutes.
     - `[]subroute <#virtualserverroute-subroute>`_
     - No
   * - ``ingressClassName``
     - Specifies which Ingress controller must handle the VirtualServerRoute resource. Must be the same as the ``ingressClassName`` of the VirtualServer that references this resource.
     - ``string``_
     - No
```

### VirtualServerRoute.Subroute

The subroute defines rules for matching client requests to actions like passing a request to an upstream. For example:
```yaml
path: /coffee
action:
  pass: coffee
```

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Type
     - Required
   * - ``path``
     - The path of the subroute. NGINX will match it against the URI of a request. Possible values are: a prefix (\ ``/``\ , ``/path``\ ), an exact match (\ ``=/exact/match``\ ), a case insensitive regular expression (\ ``~*^/Bar.*\\.jpg``\ ) or a case sensitive regular expression (\ ``~^/foo.*\\.jpg``\ ). In the case of a prefix, the path must start with the same path as the path of the route of the VirtualServer that references this resource. In the case of an exact or regex match, the path must be the same as the path of the route of the VirtualServer that references this resource. In the case of a prefix or an exact match, the path must not include any whitespace characters, ``{``\ , ``}`` or ``;``.  In the case of the regex matches, all double quotes ``"`` must be escaped and the match can't end in an unescaped backslash ``\``. The path must be unique among the paths of all subroutes of the VirtualServerRoute.
     - ``string``
     - Yes
   * - ``policies``
     - A list of policies. The policies override *all* policies defined in the route of the VirtualServer that references this resource. The policies also override the policies of the same type defined in the ``spec`` of the VirtualServer. See `Applying Policies </nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/policy-resource/#applying-policies>`_ for more details.
     - `[]policy <#virtualserver-policy>`_
     - No

   * - ``errorPages``
     - The custom responses for error codes. NGINX will use those responses instead of returning the error responses from the upstream servers or the default responses generated by NGINX. A custom response can be a redirect or a canned response. For example, a redirect to another URL if an upstream server responded with a 404 status code.
     - `[]errorPage <#errorpage>`_
     - No
   * - ``location-snippets``
     - Sets a custom snippet in the location context. Overrides the ``location-snippets`` of the VirtualServer (if set) or the ``location-snippets`` ConfigMap key.
     - ``string``
     - No
```

\* -- a subroute must include exactly one of the following: `action` or `splits`.

## Common Parts of the VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute

### Upstream

The upstream defines a destination for the routing configuration. For example:
```yaml
name: tea
service: tea-svc
subselector:
  version: canary
port: 80
lb-method: round_robin
fail-timeout: 10s
max-fails: 1
max-conns: 32
keepalive: 32
connect-timeout: 30s
read-timeout: 30s
send-timeout: 30s
next-upstream: "error timeout non_idempotent"
next-upstream-timeout: 5s
next-upstream-tries: 10
client-max-body-size: 2m
tls:
  enable: true
```

**Note**: The WebSocket protocol is supported without any additional configuration.

The queue field configures a queue. A client request will be placed into the queue if an upstream server cannot be selected immediately while processing the request:

```yaml
size: 10
timeout: 60s
```

See [`queue`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#queue) directive for additional information.

Note: This feature is supported only in NGINX Plus.

```eval_rst

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Type
     - Required
   * - ``size``
     - The size of the queue.

### Upstream.Healthcheck

The Healthcheck defines an [active health check](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-health-check/). In the example below we enable a health check for an upstream and configure all the available parameters:

```yaml
name: tea
service: tea-svc
port: 80
healthCheck:
  enable: true
  path: /healthz
  interval: 20s
  jitter: 3s
  fails: 5
  passes: 5
  port: 8080
  tls:
    enable: true
  connect-timeout: 10s
  read-timeout: 10s
  send-timeout: 10s
  headers:
  - name: Host
    value: my.service
  statusMatch: "! 500"

     - ``string``
     - No
```

### Upstream.SessionCookie

The SessionCookie field configures session persistence which allows requests from the same client to be passed to the same upstream server. The information about the designated upstream server is passed in a session cookie generated by NGINX Plus.

In the example below, we configure session persistence with a session cookie for an upstream and configure all the available parameters:

```yaml
name: tea
service: tea-svc
port: 80
sessionCookie:
  enable: true
  name: srv_id
  path: /
  expires: 1h
  domain: .example.com
  httpOnly: false
  secure: true
```
See the [`sticky`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html?#sticky) directive for additional information. The session cookie corresponds to the `sticky cookie` method.

### Action

The action defines an action to perform for a request.

In the example below, client requests are passed to an upstream `coffee`:
```yaml
 path: /coffee
 action:
  pass: coffee
```

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field

### Action.Proxy

The proxy action passes requests to an upstream with the ability to modify the request/response (for example, rewrite the URI or modify the headers).

In the example below, the request URI is rewritten to `/`, and the request and the response headers are modified:
```yaml
proxy:
  upstream: coffee
  requestHeaders:
    pass: true
    set:
    - name: My-Header
      value: Value
    - name: Client-Cert

### AddHeader

The addHeader defines an HTTP Header with an optional `always` field:
```yaml
name: My-Header
value: My-Value
always: true
```

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Type
     - Required
   * - ``name``
     - The name of the header.
     - ``string``
     - Yes
   * - ``value``
     - The value of the header. Supports NGINX variables*. Variables must be enclosed in curly brackets. For example: ``${scheme}``.
     - ``string``

### Split

The split defines a weight for an action as part of the splits configuration.

In the example below NGINX passes 80% of requests to the upstream `coffee-v1` and the remaining 20% to `coffee-v2`:
```yaml
splits:
- weight: 80
  action:
    pass: coffee-v1
- weight: 20
  action:
    pass: coffee-v2
```

```eval_rst

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Type
     - Required
   * - ``weight``
     - The weight of an action. Must fall into the range ``1..99``. The sum of the weights of all splits must be equal to ``100``.
     - ``int``
     - Yes
   * - ``action``
     - The action to perform for a request.
     - `action <#action>`_
     - Yes
```

### Match

The match defines a match between conditions and an action or splits.

In the example below, NGINX routes requests with the path `/coffee` to different upstreams based on the value of the cookie `user`:
* `user=john` -> `coffee-future`
* `user=bob` -> `coffee-deprecated`
* If the cookie is not set or not equal to either `john` or `bob`, NGINX routes to `coffee-stable`

```yaml
path: /coffee
matches:
- conditions:
  - cookie: user
    value: john
  action:
    pass: coffee-future
- conditions:
  - cookie: user
    value: bob
  action:
    pass: coffee-deprecated
action:
  pass: coffee-stable
```

In the next example, NGINX routes requests based on the value of the built-in [`$request_method` variable](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#var_request_method), which represents the HTTP method of a request:
* all POST requests -> `coffee-post`
* all non-POST requests -> `coffee`

```yaml
path: /coffee
matches:
- conditions:
  - variable: $request_method
    value: POST
  action:
    pass: coffee-post
action:
  pass: coffee
```

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Type
     - Required
   * - ``conditions``
     - A list of conditions. Must include at least 1 condition.
     - `[]condition <#condition>`_
     - Yes
   * - ``action``
     - The action to perform for a request.
     - `action <#action>`_
     - No*
   * - ``splits``
     - The splits configuration for traffic splitting. Must include at least 2 splits.
     - `[]split <#split>`_
     - No*
```

\* -- a match must include exactly one of the following: `action` or `splits`.

### Condition

The condition defines a condition in a match.

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Type
     - Required
   * - ``header``
     - The name of a header. Must consist of alphanumeric characters or ``-``.
     - ``string``
     - No*
   * - ``cookie``
     - The name of a cookie. Must consist of alphanumeric characters or ``_``.
     - ``string``
     - No*
   * - ``argument``
     - The name of an argument. Must consist of alphanumeric characters or ``_``.
     - ``string``
     - No*
   * - ``variable``
     - The name of an NGINX variable. Must start with ``$``. See the list of the supported variables below the table.
     - ``string``
     - No*
   * - ``value``
     - The value to match the condition against. How to define a value is shown below the table.
     - ``string``
     - Yes
```

\* -- a condition must include exactly one of the following: `header`, `cookie`, `argument` or `variable`.

Supported NGINX variables: `$args`, `$http2`, `$https`, `$remote_addr`, `$remote_port`, `$query_string`, `$request`, `$request_body`, `$request_uri`, `$request_method`, `$scheme`. Find the documentation for each variable [here](https://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html).

The value supports two kinds of matching:
* *Case-insensitive string comparison*. For example:
  * `john` -- case-insensitive matching that succeeds for strings, such as `john`, `John`, `JOHN`.
  * `!john` -- negation of the case-incentive matching for john that succeeds for strings, such as `bob`, `anything`, `''` (empty string).
* *Matching with a regular expression*. Note that NGINX supports regular expressions compatible with those used by the Perl programming language (PCRE). For example:
  * `~^yes` -- a case-sensitive regular expression that matches any string that starts with `yes`. For example: `yes`, `yes123`.
  * `!~^yes` -- negation of the previous regular expression that succeeds for strings like `YES`, `Yes123`, `noyes`. (The negation mechanism is not part of the PCRE syntax).
  * `~*no$` -- a case-insensitive regular expression that matches any string that ends with `no`. For example: `no`, `123no`, `123NO`.

**Note**: a value must not include any unescaped double quotes (`"`) and must not end with an unescaped backslash (`\`). For example, the following are invalid values: `some"value`, `somevalue\`.


### ErrorPage

The errorPage defines a custom response for a route for the case when either an upstream server responds with (or NGINX generates) an error status code. The custom response can be a redirect or a canned response. See the [error_page](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#error_page) directive for more information.
```yaml
path: /coffee
errorPages:
- codes: [502, 503]
  redirect:
    code: 301
    url: https://nginx.org
- codes: [404]
  return:
    code: 200
    body: "Original resource not found, but success!"

     - No*
```

\* -- an errorPage must include exactly one of the following: `return` or `redirect`.

### ErrorPage.Redirect

The redirect defines a redirect for an errorPage.

In the example below, NGINX responds with a redirect when a response from an upstream server has a 404 status code.

```yaml
codes: [404]
redirect:
  code: 301
  url: ${scheme}://cafe.example.com/error.html
```

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Type
     - Required
   * - ``code``
     - The status code of a redirect. The allowed values are: ``301``\ , ``302``\ , ``307``\ , ``308``.  The default is ``301``.
     - ``int``
     - No
   * - ``url``
     - The URL to redirect the request to. Supported NGINX variables: ``$scheme``\ and ``$http_x_forwarded_proto``\. Variables must be enclosed in curly braces. For example: ``${scheme}``.
     - ``string``
     - Yes
```

### ErrorPage.Return

The return defines a canned response for an errorPage.

In the example below, NGINX responds with a canned response when a response from an upstream server has either 401 or 403 status code.

```yaml
codes: [401, 403]
return:
  code: 200
  type: application/json
  body: |
    {\"msg\": \"You don't have permission to do this\"}
  headers:
  - name: x-debug-original-statuses
    value: ${upstream_status}
```

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Type
     - Required
   * - ``code``
     - The status code of the response. The default is the status code of the original response.
     - ``int``
     - No
   * - ``type``
     - The MIME type of the response. The default is ``text/html``.
     - ``string``
     - No
   * - ``body``
     - The body of the response. Supported NGINX variable: ``$upstream_status`` \ . Variables must be enclosed in curly braces. For example: ``${upstream_status}``.
     - ``string``
     - Yes
   * - ``headers``
     - The custom headers of the response.
     - `errorPage.Return.Header <#errorpage-return-header>`_
     - No
```

### ErrorPage.Return.Header

The header defines an HTTP Header for a canned response in an errorPage:

```yaml
name: x-debug-original-statuses
value: ${upstream_status}
```

```eval_rst
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description
     - Type
     - Required
   * - ``name``
     - The name of the header.
     - ``string``
     - Yes
   * - ``value``
     - The value of the header. Supported NGINX variable: ``$upstream_status`` \ . Variables must be enclosed in curly braces. For example: ``${upstream_status}``.
     - ``string``
     - No
```

## Using VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute

You can use the usual `kubectl` commands to work with VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources, similar to Ingress resources.

For example, the following command creates a VirtualServer resource defined in `cafe-virtual-server.yaml` with the name `cafe`:
```
$ kubectl apply -f cafe-virtual-server.yaml
virtualserver.k8s.nginx.org "cafe" created
```

You can get the resource by running:
```
$ kubectl get virtualserver cafe
NAME   STATE   HOST                   IP            PORTS      AGE
cafe   Valid   cafe.example.com       12.13.23.123  [80,443]   3m
```

In the kubectl get and similar commands, you can also use the short name `vs` instead of `virtualserver`.

Working with VirtualServerRoute resources is analogous. In the kubectl commands, use `virtualserverroute` or the short name `vsr`.

### Using Snippets

Snippets allow you to insert raw NGINX config into different contexts of NGINX configuration. In the example below, we use snippets to configure several NGINX features in a VirtualServer:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1
kind: VirtualServer
metadata:
  name: cafe
  namespace: cafe
spec:
  http-snippets: |
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=1r/s;
    proxy_cache_path /tmp keys_zone=one:10m;
  host: cafe.example.com
  tls:
    secret: cafe-secret
  server-snippets: |
    limit_req zone=mylimit burst=20;
  upstreams:
  - name: tea
    service: tea-svc
    port: 80
  - name: coffee
    service: coffee-svc
    port: 80
  routes:
  - path: /tea
    location-snippets: |
      proxy_cache one;
      proxy_cache_valid 200 10m;
    action:
      pass: tea
  - path: /coffee
    action:
      pass: coffee
```

Snippets are intended to be used by advanced NGINX users who need more control over the generated NGINX configuration.

However, because of the disadvantages described below, snippets are disabled by default. To use snippets, set the [`enable-snippets`](/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments#cmdoption-enable-snippets) command-line argument.

Disadvantages of using snippets:
* *Complexity*. To use snippets, you will need to:
  * Understand NGINX configuration primitives and implement a correct NGINX configuration.
  * Understand how the IC generates NGINX configuration so that a snippet doesn't interfere with the other features in the configuration.
* *Decreased robustness*. An incorrect snippet makes the NGINX config invalid which will lead to a failed reload. This will prevent any new configuration updates, including updates for the other VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources until the snippet is fixed.
* *Security implications*. Snippets give access to NGINX configuration primitives and those primitives are not validated by the Ingress Controller. For example, a snippet can configure NGINX to serve the TLS certificates and keys used for TLS termination for Ingress and VirtualServer resources.

To help catch errors when using snippets, the Ingress Controller reports config reload errors in the logs as well as in the events and status field of VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources. Additionally, a number of Prometheus metrics show the stats about failed reloads – `controller_nginx_last_reload_status` and `controller_nginx_reload_errors_total`.

> Note that during a period when the NGINX config includes an invalid snippet, NGINX will continue to operate with the latest valid configuration.

### Validation

Two types of validation are available for VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources:
* *Structural validation* by the `kubectl` and Kubernetes API server.
* *Comprehensive validation* by the Ingress Controller.

#### Structural Validation

The custom resource definitions for VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute include structural OpenAPI schema which describes the type of every field of those resources.

If you try to create (or update) a resource that violates the structural schema (for example, you use a string value for the port field of an upstream), `kubectl` and Kubernetes API server will reject such a resource:
* Example of `kubectl` validation:
    ```
    $ kubectl apply -f cafe-virtual-server.yaml
      error: error validating "cafe-virtual-server.yaml": error validating data: ValidationError(VirtualServer.spec.upstreams[0].port): invalid type for org.nginx.k8s.v1.VirtualServer.spec.upstreams.port: got "string", expected "integer"; if you choose to ignore these errors, turn validation off with --validate=false
    ```
* Example of Kubernetes API server validation:
    ```
    $ kubectl apply -f cafe-virtual-server.yaml --validate=false
      The VirtualServer "cafe" is invalid: []: Invalid value: map[string]interface {}{ ... }: validation failure list:
      spec.upstreams.port in body must be of type integer: "string"
    ```

If a resource is not rejected (it doesn't violate the structural schema), the Ingress Controller will validate it further.

#### Comprehensive Validation

The Ingress Controller validates the fields of the VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoute resources. If a resource is invalid, the Ingress Controller will reject it: the resource will continue to exist in the cluster, but the Ingress Controller will ignore it.

You can check if the Ingress Controller successfully applied the configuration for a VirtualServer. For our example `cafe` VirtualServer, we can run:
```
$ kubectl describe vs cafe
. . .
Events:
  Type    Reason          Age   From                      Message
  ----    ------          ----  ----                      -------
  Normal  AddedOrUpdated  16s   nginx-ingress-controller  Configuration for default/cafe was added or updated
```
Note how the events section includes a Normal event with the AddedOrUpdated reason that informs us that the configuration was successfully applied.

If you create an invalid resource, the Ingress Controller will reject it and emit a Rejected event. For example, if you create a VirtualServer `cafe` with two upstream with the same name `tea`, you will get:
```
$ kubectl describe vs cafe
. . .
Events:
  Type     Reason    Age   From                      Message
  ----     ------    ----  ----                      -------
  Warning  Rejected  12s   nginx-ingress-controller  VirtualServer default/cafe is invalid and was rejected: spec.upstreams[1].name: Duplicate value: "tea"
```
Note how the events section includes a Warning event with the Rejected reason.

Additionally, this information is also available in the `status` field of the VirtualServer resource. Note the Status section of the VirtualServer:

```
$ kubectl describe vs cafe
. . .
Status:
  External Endpoints:
    Ip:        12.13.23.123
    Ports:     [80,443]
  Message:  VirtualServer default/cafe is invalid and was rejected: spec.upstreams[1].name: Duplicate value: "tea"
  Reason:   Rejected
  State:    Invalid
```

The Ingress Controller validates VirtualServerRoute resources in a similar way.

**Note**: If you make an existing resource invalid, the Ingress Controller will reject it and remove the corresponding configuration from NGINX.

## Customization via ConfigMap

You can customize the NGINX configuration for VirtualServer and VirtualServerRoutes resources using the [ConfigMap](/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/configmap-resource). Most of the ConfigMap keys are supported, with the following exceptions:
* `proxy-hide-headers`
* `proxy-pass-headers`
* `hsts`
* `hsts-max-age`
* `hsts-include-subdomains`
* `hsts-behind-proxy`
* `redirect-to-https`
* `ssl-redirect`
